description: Produce a detailed plan without executing anything
---

Think carefully and output a structured plan only. Do **not** run any commands or make edits.  
Your output must always include:

## Goal
(Brief summary of what the user asked)

## Assumptions
(Any assumptions you are making)

## Step-by-Step Plan
1. Numbered steps with exact file paths, edits, and commands
2. Be specific and concrete

## Success Criteria
(What it looks like if the plan is successful)

End with:
`Approve to execute? (yes/no)`
