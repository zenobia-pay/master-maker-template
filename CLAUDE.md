## Project Structure

This project uses a very opinionated structure to create maintainable, scalable, and correct full-stack applications. Before implementing any user request, you must translate it into one of the following step types:

## Step Types

All implementation tasks must be one of these specific step types:

### 1. `database-schema`

**Purpose**: Define or modify database schemas for both D1 (global) and SQLite shard (per-user) tables.

**Implementation Details**:

- **D1 Schema** (global): Contains shared data like users table, authentication info
- **Shard Schema** (per-user): Contains user-specific data like projects, orders, transactions
- Location: Update schema files in `src/durable-objects/user-shard/schema.ts`
- After changes: Run `npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate:dev && npm run db:generate:user-shard`
- NEVER run `npm run dev` - the preview is managed by another process

### 2. `page-static`

**Purpose**: Create a complete static page (e.g., landing page, about page, terms page).

**Implementation Details**:

- **IMPORTANT**: Use the `dolphinmade` CLI tool to create the page structure:
  ```bash
  dolphinmade create-page <name> --type static
  ```
  Example: `dolphinmade create-page landing --type static`

- The CLI automatically:
  - Creates static HTML file structure
  - Updates `vite.config.ts` with the new route
  - Sets up basic page template

- After running the CLI, implement all content in the HTML file:
  - Hero section with headline, subheadline, and visuals
  - Feature sections with descriptions
  - Call-to-action buttons and links
  - Footer with navigation links
  - All styling and layout
  - Any images or visual assets

- **IMPORTANT**: If creating a "landing" page, manually update `vite.config.ts` to set the landing page as the main route at `/` instead of `/landing`

### 3. `page-dynamic`

**Purpose**: Create a complete dynamic page with full functionality (e.g., dashboard, profile, admin panel).

**Implementation Details**:

This is a comprehensive step that includes ALL sub-tasks for creating a fully functional dynamic page:

#### A. Create Page Structure
- **IMPORTANT**: Use the `dolphinmade` CLI tool:
  ```bash
  dolphinmade create-page <name> --type dashboard
  ```
  Example: `dolphinmade create-page admin --type dashboard`

- The CLI automatically:
  - Creates dashboard structure with SolidJS components
  - Sets up context, views, API client
  - Creates autosave service, undo/redo service, and event processor
  - Adds necessary types to schemas and routes
  - Updates `vite.config.ts` with the new route

#### B. Setup Load Endpoint
- Modify the `/load/` endpoint for the page
- Query shard database for required entities
- Initialize context with fetched data structure
- Ensure all data needed for initial render is included
- Run typecheck after changes and fix any errors.

#### C. Build UI Components
- Create components that read from context store
- NO local state in subcomponents - all state from context
- NO type definitions in subcomponents
- Ensure components are reactive to context changes
- Place components in appropriate view within Dashboard
- Follow existing component patterns and styling
- Run typecheck after changes and fix any errors.

#### D. Define Events
- Create JSON type definitions in `events.ts` file
- Include all information needed to execute AND reverse the change
- Events should be atomic and self-contained
- Example:
  ```typescript
  {
    type: "update-item",
    itemId: string,
    oldValue: any,
    newValue: any
  }
  ```
- Run typecheck after changes and fix any errors.

#### E. Create Backend Event Handlers
- Create handler functions in `handlers` folder
- Use Drizzle ORM update methods
- Update shard database accordingly
- Do NOT create new endpoints - handlers are called by existing save endpoint
- Ensure proper error handling and validation
- Run typecheck after changes and fix any errors.

#### F. Create Frontend Event Handlers
- Create client-side handlers that update the context store
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Call `emitEvent` with the appropriate change type
- Handler should update relevant parts of the store
- UI will automatically re-render based on context changes
- Run typecheck after changes and fix any errors.

## Important Guidelines

1. **State Management**: All state lives in context, components are purely derived
2. **Type Safety**: Run typecheck after changes to ensure nothing is missed
3. **No New Endpoints**: Use existing `/load/` and `/save/` patterns
4. **Event-Driven**: All changes go through the event system for consistency
5. **Preview Management**: Use `npm run preview:start` after DB changes, never `npm run dev`
6. **Typescript Style**: Always avoid using any as a type. Explicitly define and use a single type defined in the types.ts folder

## CRITICAL FINAL STEP

**After completing ALL implementation work**, you MUST run a typecheck to catch any errors:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

If there are ANY TypeScript errors, you MUST fix them before considering the task complete. This includes:

- Missing type definitions
- Incorrect type usage
- Missing imports or exports
- Handler function signature mismatches
- Any other TypeScript compilation errors

Do not skip this step - TypeScript errors will cause runtime failures and break the application.

## Tool Calls
This container has provided several tools for you, such as preview management, image search, etc. All tools are executable scripts located in the /tools/ folder. Each script includes extensive documentation on how to use it at the top of the script. Use as appropriate.

IMPORTANT: Check the /tools/ folder for any useful tools before executing calls
IMPORTANT: DO NOT RUN npm run dev. Previews are managed separately by pm2 and should not be changed by you!
